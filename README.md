# eveCalc
If the day before Christmas is Christmas eve, does that make the day before Christmas eve, Christmas eve eve?
And the day before that Christmas eve eve eve?

This program aims to take that to its logical extreme, finding the eve of the current date to your holiday of choice. 

## Implementation
It does this by finding the next occurance of the holiday, and then taking the difference between those two dates. With that information, eve can be added to the statement to know what eve the current date is. 
The plan is to keep a json file with multiple holidays with their respective dates that the user can choose from, or have the ability for the user to enter their own dates to find the eve of.

## Discord
Ultimately the plan is for this to be a discord bot. The bot will be able to quickly calculate the eve of a requested holiday, eve of a specific date that the user requests, as well as list the holidays that it currently has in its library. 

## Things left to put in
Title | Description
-------------------
json | list of holidays to make (currently have christmas hard coded)
user choice | create function to allow user to choose holiday
custom date | allow user to choose own event to calc eve of
discord | create discord bot
